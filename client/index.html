          For my family, traveling is an important event. 
          Before you go, you need to seriously think and think 
          over all the moments of your trip, starting with where we
           will go and who we will take with us, and ending with how we 
           will store our luggage and which applications to download. 
           Planning a trip is an important skill. After returning home, 
           I would like to save important moments of travel, such as the dates 
           and places that I visited. With my application, you can easily do it.
